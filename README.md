# 📝 GoalsApp – Simple React Native Frontend Project

**GoalsApp**  
A basic React Native application built with JavaScript to practice core frontend concepts such as user input handling, state management, conditional rendering, and modal usage.

## 📱 Overview

This app was created as a learning exercise to explore the fundamentals of **React Native** UI development. It contains a single screen:

- **Main Screen**: Displays a list of goals using a `FlatList` with lazy loading. If there are no goals, the list appears empty.

A modal is used to input new goals:
- **Add Goal Modal**: Contains an input field and two buttons:
  - **Add**: Adds the entered goal and closes the modal.
  - **Cancel**: Closes the modal without adding a goal.

If the user tries to add a goal without typing anything, an alert appears prompting them to enter a valid goal.
